The goal of this project is to make an interactive 3d museum that is generated
procedurally, using content from wikipedia to fill exhibits. The museum is
virtually limitless, allowing you to take doors from one exhibit to another,
depending on what is linked from that wikipedia article.

The text of the article is also inserted as informative plaques on the wall, so you
can read about the exhibit while looking at the pictures from it. Images are also
pulled from wikimedia commons in the category corresponding to the article.

Every exhibit is filled with hallways to other exhibits, based on the links in the
current exhibit's wikipedia page. You'll never run out of things to explore!

## Multiplayer

Explore the museum with friends! The Museum of All Things now supports online
multiplayer for up to 16 players.

### Features

- **Host or Join**: Start your own server or connect to a friend's game
- **Player Customization**: Set your name, choose a color, or use a custom skin from any Wikimedia image URL
- **Player Voting**: Vote for your target article, race to whatever target has the most votes
- **Explore Together**: See other players in real-time as you walk through exhibits
- **Modern UI**: Enjoy a clean and consistent UI that fits the original MOAT experience
- **In Game Chat**: Have some in game trash talking as you race with the newly added text chat
- **Player Mounting**: Climb on top of other players and ride around the museum together
- **Room-Based Visibility**: Players are only visible when in the same exhibit, keeping things focused

## Contributing

If you encounter bugs in the museum, file them on the [issues
page.](https://github.com/m4ym4y/museum-of-all-things/issues) **Please include
the platform you're running on, and the name of the exhibit that the bug
occurred in.** (screenshots are also helpful)

You may file feature requests, but keep in mind that I'm a solo developer
distributing a free project. I'll prioritize whatever I have time for and feel
motivated to work on.

~~I do not currently have any policy for allowing outside contributors to the
codebase. I might change that in the future, particularly if I pursue
localization in other languages.~~

[**Are you interested in adding your language to the Museum of All Things? Click Here!!**](docs/translation-guide.md)

There are now many contributors to this project! Feel free to submit any pull
request and I will review it. I am more likely to accept PRs that are bugfixes or
optimizations/visual upgrades. As for things that affect the creative direction
of the museum I am still a bit precious about controlling that roadmap myself so
no guarantees that those types of changes will be merged. If you are unsure, file
an issue and we can discuss it before you put too much work in.
